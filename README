You can use and modify it as you want. 
If you have any question, please let me known!  

How to use it?

1. add location in nginx.conf:

	location /testcgi { 
	    fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;  
	    include        fastcgi_params;
	}

2. change line 30 in src/fcgi.hpp  as the following:

#define nginx_context_path "^/testcgi"
	
3. copy src/endp0_impl.hpp to src/test_impl.hpp

   add #include "test_impl.hpp" in the main.cpp like line 27.

   change the namespace endpoint0 to a new namespace what you wanted in src/test_impl.hpp
   
   change uri endpoint in line 18 as you want: 
   		auto & t0 = fcgi::Endpoints[nginx_context_path "/t0.*"];
   		
   edit lambda function of "on_call" in src/test_impl.hpp as you want.
   		[]( fcgi:: request & req, fcgi::response & resp) {
   		  modify as you want ...
   		}
   		
   see fcgi::request and fcgi::response for details. 
   		
see INSTALL to build this project.
